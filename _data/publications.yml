  abstract: "Cervical cancer screening through cytopathological images is challenging due to the complexity of cancer cells, leading to high misdiagnosis rates. This study introduces the Integrated Attention-Transformer System (IATS), a novel framework that enhances accuracy by combining Vision Transformers (ViT), Token-to-Token mechanisms, and SeNet-integrated CNNs. Unlike traditional CNNs, IATS effectively captures both global and local features, improving cancer cell identification. A weighted voting mechanism further refines predictions, reducing misdiagnosis risk. The framework achieves 98.44% accuracy on the Mendeley dataset and 95.88% on SIPaKMeD, outperforming 25 deep learning models and surpassing the best CNN model by 2.5%. These results highlight IATSâ€™s potential to revolutionize cervical cancer screening, with future work focusing on computational efficiency and clinical integration."
