I recently visited [Jialichuang (JLC)](https://www.jlcpcb.com/), a leading PCB manufacturer in **Zhuhai, Guangdong, China**, for a full-day tour of their facilities. The visit provided an in-depth look at their step-by-step **PCB production process**, including fabrication, quality control, and **Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly**, offering valuable insights into large-scale PCB manufacturing.
