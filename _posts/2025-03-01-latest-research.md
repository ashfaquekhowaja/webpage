I recently visited [Jialichuang (JLC)](https://jlcpcb.com/), a leading PCB manufacturer in **Zhuhai, Guangdong, China**, for a full-day tour of their facilities. The visit provided an in-depth look at their **step-by-step PCB production process**, including fabrication, quality control, and **Surface Mount Technology (SMT)** assembly, offering valuable insights into large-scale PCB manufacturing
