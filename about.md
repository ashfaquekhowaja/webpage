I am a PhD student at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), China, currently working under the supervision of [Prof. Seungwoo Je](https://immersivedesignresearch.com/seungwoo) at the [Immersive Design Group](https://immersivedesignresearch.com/). My research focuses on computer vision, embedded systems, and haptic technologies.

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from [Guilin University of Electronic Technology](https://www.guet.edu.cn/caaueii_english/2023/0203/c3718a32091/page.htm), followed by a Master’s degree from [Central South University](https://en.csu.edu.cn/). During my Master’s, I conducted research in medical image processing, specifically exploring deep learning techniques for cervical cancer classification. My work in this area led to several publications in peer-reviewed journals and conferences.

Currently, I am researching on Electric Impedance Tomography (EIT) and its applications in medical and HCI. Alongside my research, I served as a Teaching Assistant for fall 2024 semeter, assisting undergraduate students in AI hardware and embedded systems, the course name was "Responsive Systems".

My technical expertise includes PCB design, STM32, ESP32, CH32V003 microcontrollers, and AI-driven embedded systems. I am also actively involved in academic conferences and workshops to share my research and knowledge with others.

Beyond my academic and research pursuits, I enjoy creating [videos and vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/@AshfaqueKhowaja) about life in China, sharing my experiences and insights with a wider audience.
