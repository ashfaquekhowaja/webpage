## Visited Jialichuang JLC, a PCB Manufacturing Company in China.

I recently visited Jialichuang (JLC), a leading PCB manufacturer in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China, for a full-day tour of their facilities. The visit provided an in-depth look at their step-by-step PCB production process, including fabrication, quality control, and Surface Mount Technology (SMT) assembly, offering valuable insights into large-scale PCB manufacturing.
